												<h4 style="text-align: center;"> More than a century of oil production experience: </h4>

															<p>&emsp; Industrial oil production in Uzbekistan began in 1885. Oil was extracted from two wells near the village of Chimion in the Ferghana Valley. Serious exploration work began in the area in 1900, and in 1904 an oil fountain erupted from a depth of more than 270 meters; </p>

												<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Many years of experience in hydrocarbon processing: </h4>

															<p>&emsp; In 1906, an oil refinery was built in the Ferghana region, which consisted of two Cuban units per cycle. The oil field was transported by fire engines. Oil quality was determined using a thermometer and hydrometer. The main products obtained during processing were kerosene and fuel oil. At that time, unnecessary gasoline was burned in quarries outside the plant. Between 1915 and 1916, gasoline became a useful product in Central Asia only after the advent of internal combustion engines. Products were exported to Afghanistan and China by rail and road. In 1907, the Nobel brothers purchased the plant and began its gradual reconstruction. Within three years, a four-inch pipeline from the Chimion cone to the plant began to operate and a tank farm was built. </p>

															<p>&emsp; In 1972, the Mubarak gas processing plant, one of the largest in the world, was built in the Kashkadarya region, and in 1980, Shurtan; </p>

												<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Over half a century of gas production experience: </h4>

															<p>&emsp; The first gas was produced in 1953 from the Setalantepa field in the Kyzylkum desert. After commissioning the unique Gazli field in 1962, the transcontinental gas pipelines Bukhara-Ural and Central Asia-Central were laid. </p>

												<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Industry development over the years of independence: </h4>

															<p>&emsp; From the first days of independence of the Republic of Uzbekistan, a new life of the industry began, a new stage in the development of the oil and gas industry. The country's leadership attaches great importance to the large-scale development of this sector. </p>

															<p>&emsp; After independence of Uzbekistan and the beginning of economic reforms in the country in 1992, special attention was paid to the oil and gas sector. </p>

															<p>&emsp; The stages of structural changes that ensure the evolutionary transition from administrative command to a market mechanism were carried out by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan I.A. Karimov in 1992, performing the following strategic tasks: </p>

															<p>&emsp; The first gas was produced in 1953 from the Setalantepa field in the Kyzylkum desert. After commissioning the unique Gazli field in 1962, the transcontinental gas pipelines Bukhara-Ural and Central Asia-Central were laid. </p>

															<p>
															&mdash; A significant increase in oil and gas condensate production in order to achieve oil independence of the republic; <br> 
															&mdash; Deepening the process of technological processing of oil and gas in order to bring product quality to world standards; <br>
															&mdash; To increase the reserves of liquid hydrocarbons, primarily due to the discovery of new fields in order to ensure reliable supplies of raw materials for the oil and gas industry of Uzbekistan. <br>  <br> 
															On May 3, 1992, the Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov “On the creation of the State Concern Uzbekneftegaz in the oil and gas industry of Uzbekistan” was signed. </p>
